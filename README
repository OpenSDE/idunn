Idunn, the guardian of eternal youth
====================================

Idunn is an small system aiming to give an early rescue/install
environment with ssh support, making life easier when one doesn't
have physical access to machine.

OpenVPN client support is also desired so one can connect to the
rescue/install envrionment even when it's behind gateways and
firewalls without needing specific NAT rules.

Idunn is under GPLv2 license, as showed in the COPYING file
included, and made to be built and maintained using OpenSDE [1].
